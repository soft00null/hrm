Agriculture Department Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy, and the development of the agricultural sector is crucial for the overall progress of the country. In the post-independence era, especially from 1950 to 1965, significant emphasis was placed on the expansion of agricultural land. During this period, efforts were made to increase the area under cultivation as well as expand irrigated farmland. Additionally, in 1961-62, the use of chemical fertilizers was introduced. From 1965-66 onwards, the development of improved crop varieties laid the foundation for the Green Revolution in India.Subsequent five-year plans further accelerated agricultural development. To boost production, improved seeds, efficient fertilizer management, controlled use of pesticides, and water conservation techniques were widely adopted. Moreover, to ensure farmers had access to modern agricultural knowledge, initiatives such as agricultural universities, experimental projects, field visits, seminars, conferences, fairs, and exhibitions were organized. These efforts significantly contributed to increasing agricultural production. Although India has achieved self-sufficiency in food grain production, the need to maximize economic benefits for farmers through modern agricultural technology remains essential. Therefore, various schemes are being implemented to promote agricultural processing industries, exports, and horticulture along with advanced farming techniques. The primary objective of the Zilla Parishad Pune, Agriculture Department is to provide farmers with knowledge of modern agricultural technologies, empower them to increase their income, and ensure the optimal utilization of all available agricultural resources. Following the principle of “Welfare for Many, Happiness for Many,” the Zilla Parishad Pune, Agriculture Department is continuously working for the economic and social advancement of farmers.

Moreover, to ensure farmers had access to modern agricultural knowledge, initiatives such as agricultural universities, experimental projects, field visits, seminars, conferences, fairs, and exhibitions were organized. These efforts significantly contributed to increasing agricultural production. Although India has achieved self-sufficiency in food grain production, the need to maximize economic benefits for farmers through modern agricultural technology remains essential. Therefore, various schemes are being implemented to promote agricultural processing industries, exports, and horticulture along with advanced farming techniques. The primary objective of the Zilla Parishad Pune, Agriculture Department is to provide farmers with knowledge of modern agricultural technologies, empower them to increase their income, and ensure the optimal utilization of all available agricultural resources. Following the principle of “Welfare for Many, Happiness for Many,” the Zilla Parishad Pune, Agriculture Department is continuously working for the economic and social advancement of farmers.

Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy, and the development of the agricultural sector is crucial for the overall progress of the country. In the post-independence era, especially from 1950 to 1965, significant emphasis was placed on the expansion of agricultural land. During this period, efforts were made to increase the area under cultivation as well as expand irrigated farmland. Additionally, in 1961-62, the use of chemical fertilizers was introduced.
From 1965-66 onwards, the development of improved crop varieties laid the foundation for the Green Revolution in India.Subsequent five-year plans further accelerated agricultural development. To boost production, improved seeds, efficient fertilizer management, controlled use of pesticides, and water conservation techniques were widely adopted. Moreover, to ensure farmers had access to modern agricultural knowledge, initiatives such as agricultural universities, experimental projects, field visits, seminars, conferences, fairs, and exhibitions were organized. These efforts significantly contributed to increasing agricultural production.
Although India has achieved self-sufficiency in food grain production, the need to maximize economic benefits for farmers through modern agricultural technology remains essential. Therefore, various schemes are being implemented to promote agricultural processing industries, exports, and horticulture along with advanced farming techniques.
